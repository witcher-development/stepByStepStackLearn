* [Repo](https://github.com/czechue/webpack-4-vanilla-js-starter)
* [Instruction](https://github.com/czechue/webpack-4-vanilla-js-starter/blob/master/README.md)

### Development:
* clone this repo
```
cd <repo-name>
npm install
npm start
``` 
* webpack server will start automatically in your browser at:
```json
http://localhost:8080/
```

* starting points - these files are required:
```
/src/index.html         // template
/src/styles/main.css    // main .css file
/src/scripts/index.js   // main .js file

```
(rest of files and folders are optional)

* modify only files in `/src` directory, webpack server will hot reload on every file change

#### Production build:
* run:
```
npm run build
```
* `/dist` directory with production-ready code will be added

#### Tips:
* add images any any other sources to your index.html with `require()`:
```html
<img src="${require('./assets/images/my-image.svg')}" alt="" />
```
* in .scss files URLs are always relative to `/src/styles/main.scss` file
```scss
/src/styles/base/_base.scss
.class-name {
  // these assets are always relative to main.scss file
  background: url('../assets/images/my-image.svg');
}
```
* if you are using sugested styles/folder SCSS architecture, remember that after adding new _file.scss you should import it to main.scss file, and restart webpack dev server (`npm start`)
